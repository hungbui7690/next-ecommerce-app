/*
  Add to Cart Functionality
  - we will use react context api to manage cart


-----------------------

  - The use-local-storage-state package makes it easier to persist data in the browser by abstracting the use of localStorage into a React Hook. It can save data and parse them automatically, and we can use it in multiple places in our app.

  1. components/ProductsContext.jsx
  2. components/Footer.jsx
